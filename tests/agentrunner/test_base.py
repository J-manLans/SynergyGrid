    This test suite verifies that the `AgentRunner` class functions correctly in various scenarios. Specifically, it tests:
    - The initialization of an `AgentRunner` object.
    - Handling of invalid algorithms.
    - Behavior when model steps are not provided.
    - Behavior when no matching model is found for the specified steps.

    Tests are designed to check edge cases, error handling, and correct interactions with the underlying model-loading functionality.
